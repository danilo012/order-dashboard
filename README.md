# BizBoard Application

Bizboard is a full stack ReactJS web application catered to small businesses. From bakeries to tailors and barbers, local businesses need a way of tracking orders and their clients. The high end Microsoft and cloud technologies are always developed for larger businesses and enterprises. In addition, they cost money and are hard to use.

This web application lets a business add orders to their dashboard which has all the information they need about the order. The employer can track the progress of the order (open/pending/closed) to know if the order is complete or paid. With it's responsive design, it can be used where ever on whatever device. From the iPad at the store to a phone while on the go, a business can add orders to stay on top of production.

Fully hashed authentication allows for the users data to stay secure like all the pay-services that the big companies use, however, BizBoard is much more feasible for the small local business.
