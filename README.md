## Motivation

The high end Microsoft and cloud technologies are always developed for larger businesses and enterprises. In addition, they cost money and are hard to use. This free open source project allows businesses to not have to get caught up in which SAAS to purchase. From the iPad at the store to a phone while on the go, employers stay on top of production.
