I just graduated this May after 3 years at Indiana University: BS in Informatics and Minor in CS. *[Informatics being more broad and about IT as a whole, and human side of computing, minor in CS being for the actual code/algorithms]*

Because I was graduating early, internships turned me down, *"you need to be enrolled in school"* and FT turned me down because *"you have no internship experience and are too young"* so it sucked, but I did get this Part Time "internship" deal with a company as a "HTML5 web developer." Even though it is $15/hr and I'm making no more as I would working at the University Caf√©, I take it (only option) and can't complain.

# 5 Months later...

... And they still haven't offered FT yet. It was mentioned by mentor that it was *"in the works"* but that was two months ago, and that topic has reappeared here and there since. But nothing. However, I'm not disappointed because it's actually not what I anticipated as a developer job....

- It's not challenging anymore after I've spent the past month outside of work really learning a ton and doing my own projects
- The company doesn't seem to have a high standard of dev work. Ex: I -**as a complete amateur in this field who is at the bottom of the totem poll**- think that some of what they develop is... bad? poor code/technique from other developers. The things they showcase for clients is 2006 era web development. 1) UI looks like a 2006 web site 2) they didn't have a dev/production environment until I showed up and made one. Not sure how they do what they specialize in and not have automated builds for their projects. It had to taken them so long to do it manually. Which leads me to believe they aren't the best, but fulfill their market in the local area.
- Repetitive work, reinventing the wheel for a worse product if you hadn't reinvented (reasons same as above), everyone is slow at their work for some reason, idk why but I seem to complete tasks quicker than expected? I have to drag tasks out longer rather than being productive.
- I assume it will be low pay if FT offered, and barely over $15/hr in salary.

Over the past month, outside of work, I've worked on my portfolio to learn things in web development since its such a huge field. I still feel like a rookie, and am lost since **I went to college because I was told that getting a solid job out of college would be significantly easier.** But I'm stuck in the mud it seems.

# Peers all got jobs...

**Peers who graduated alongside me but didn't have more skills on their resume have gotten 3 month summer internships that led into FT offers for a normal 50K+.** I'm also struggling because their positions are vague "business analyst" positions. They describe their day as "doing some SQL queries, working with some data in excel" and things that sound really basic tbh. It confuses me how that's getting them 50k salary offers? (unless they exaggerated? idk)

**To get there, they had to do something I'm missing out on.** So, I'm trying to figure out what else I need to be doing to get a real FT job. In my case, narrowing in on web dev as a development start, like I said, I've been spending hours the past month learning. I only have 2 full stack big apps in my portfolio (one is still in dev), and the rest are smaller scale projects as you can see, so maybe that's my issue. **Applying to jobs, maybe I just need to target populated urban cities more? My small college town just doesn't have a lot to offer, but maybe even my close cities are still over saturated with better prospects? idk...**

# I expected college to be different...

Like I said, I guess my view of college was different than reality? But with everyone else doing just fine without huge enormous resumes of skills and experience, I question that thought too. As a student instructor who taught undergrads my age and younger, I saw/graded over 200+ sample size of students in my degree. A solid 20% I questioned how they were going to graduate/get a job. 20% you could tell they were really smart and knew that they have a great resume without even seeing it. But then the 60% rest were just normal. **Yet, here I am still among the bottom 20% still looking for a real FT job. *I have got to be missing something that everyone else has under their belt***
